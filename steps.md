Notice:
-------
If you are making a Mini-app from an existing software project, do not name the mini-app after the parent software package.
This can be confusing to everyone involved in the release chain that you are trying to release an open source version of X.


Steps so far
- Get an SACR
  - Respectfully email leslie.j.johnson@nasa.gov and ask about steps for open source software release
  - She will email you back a thorough description of Safety classifications and a list of questions
  - Email her back the answers to her questions based on the project you are looking to release.
  - She will send you back an initial SACR.
  - You now need an RMM to send back to her. 
- Start an NTR
  - Go to https://invention.nasa.gov/ to create an initial NTR
  - Fill it out
  - Submit it
  - Tell any co-authors they need to "review it" by logging in and clicking through.  For any required comment box they can enter "correct to my knowledge".

- Get an RMM
  - Once you have an initial SACR from Leslie you will have a classification (D, or E).
  - Get the appropriate example from:  https://gitlab.larc.nasa.gov/mpark/casb-sw-mgmt-plan
  - Rename the file to be `RMM_<project>.xlsx`
  - Read through the document, but likely you will just need to alter the CASB required column j. This is the column of "evidence" that you are, in fact, taking action that makes the project fully compliant.
  - "Sign" this excel file by typing in your name and date.
  - Send this to Beth to sign.
  - Then email the signed copy to Leslie.
